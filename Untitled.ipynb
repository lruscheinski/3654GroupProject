    "# Potential Questions: \n",
    "Who is the NBA guard with the highest offensive output of all time? \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "What is the best box statistic (basic stat ie. Points, rebounds, assists) to predict offensive output?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "What actual metrics actually compares offensive output?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Should we consider the time spent as an NBA player for our ranking?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Potential References \n",
    "\n",
    "These two sources will hopefully help us assess different strengths and weaknesses of various NBA guards. We will use this data to answer the potential questions and may help us think of new questions and relationships to consider.\n",
